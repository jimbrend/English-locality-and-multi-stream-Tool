## test

Think I found what is the reliable multi-tool OBS plugin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m-IQfA_LV8&pp=ygUYbXVsdGkgc3RyZWFtIHR3aXRjaCB0b29s
(installation and source in the details: https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/multiple-rtmp-outputs-plugin.964/)
(curious if anyone uses another one?)

Elon tweeted steps here a while ago and streamed 3 times (luckily he was able to fix his audio problem he sounded like a chipmunk and was getting echo on the first one lol): https://x.com/marmars/status/1708195875510796673?s=20

I tried testing it once but I guess it uses the periscope backend, I think it's hard to connect and interact with a streamer/support them as there's no like easy way to subscribe/tip/bits etc. like easily in one about section and things now so feels like it's disjointed but definitely X has potential: https://studio.twitter.com/producer/sources

I believe that is where you create a source, I tried testing once but didn't do a deeper dive yet - but I believe it can show easily in your twitter feed, and then maybe from there could post links to Twitch etc. or have the old Periscope chat open

i have confirmed this since you can simulcast to X, twitch, and Nostr/zap.stream at once and popout and monitor all their chats on web

If curious too https://zap.stream/ is another new platform you could multi-stream too that has a pretty niche streamer community there, the platform is not too satured yet which could be a good thing for people streaming there (the new UX has since greatly improved with a new user dashboard, an old coworker created this platform https://git.v0l.io/Kieran), you have to login there with a Nostr pubkey, also if you leak your address or something by accident you can’t delete your Nostr broadcast (you can’t delete Nostr posts they’re hosted on multiple relays/servers, there’s no delete button)  But zap.stream uses AWS servers so I think it expires after 3 months… (Nostr caters to only text connections hosted in a decentralized/uncensored manner on its frontend, but can't store a lot of data so there is also like a streaming music service that uses AWS backend for the music being built on it as well as a ton of other projects, mostly all curated here if interested: https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr)  It does incentivize ppl making/streaming micropayments there though which is cool (seems the market hasn't yet really accepted streaming payments imo), it starts you off with 1000 sats last time I checked at zap.stream and it’s 21/sats a min to upkeep the stream / about $1.50 - one of the wizards at my last job at Strike made zap.stream which is cool this Kieran fellow (https://x.com/_v0ld
https://github.com/v0l)

Nostr user base kind of plateaued (I preface this from a normal/mainstream perspective only brcause nostr has had periods of growth to 35M userd and slumps to what looks like 50k or less MAU from thr numbers i can tell) though until maybe another killer app comes along, all the apps for those are interoperable though you login with the same pubkey for your account on all of them - Damus (if you're on Damus you see the same posts from popular users as users browsing on Iris, Amethyst, Snort.social, Astra.ninja interfaces too for the Nostr social feeds) Damus is the biggest one right now a Twitter clone on the App Store… it's a bit of an echo chamber for Bitcoin but people claim it's less toxic than X and you can't be banned there (a bit of a conundrum), one benefit is if you develop a social app or something similar you immediately connect to the 25 million or so userbase can login to your app and there's no KYC onboarding,

## 为什么首页是日语？ / Why is the homepage in Japanese?

因为最初是做给管人用的。

Because it's originally made for virtual Youtubers (VTubers).
